# Bdog's MythicMobs Projects
A repository for my mythic mob projects

## Visibility Scoreboard System 
This system in MythicMobs makes it so mobs can only be seen by players with a certain scoreboard value.


### Files
[Mobs](Mobs/VisibilityMob.yml) & [Skills](Skills/VisibilitySkills.yml)

### Usage
Once the files are installed in your mythicmob directories, you can create a scoreboard value in game named **'Visibility'** and summon the Visibility mob. Here you can see me toggle my scoreboard value of **'Visibility'** from NULL to 1 to 0 to test the different boolean states that you can see the test mob in.
