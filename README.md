## Visibility Scoreboard System 

These files, [VisibilityMob.yml](Mobs/VisibilityMob.yml) and [VisibilitySkills.yml](Skills/VisibilitySkills.yml) , allow you to implement a visibility system in MythicMobs, where mobs can only be seen by players with a certain scoreboard value. 

### Usage
Once the files are installed in your mythicmob directories, you can create a scoreboard value in game named 'visibility' and summon the Visibility mob. Here you can see me toggle my scoreboard value of 'visibility' from NULL to 1 to 0 to test the different boolean states that you can see the test mob in.
