<a name="VIS">## Visibility Scoreboard System </a>
Mobs can only be seen by players with a certain scoreboard value.


### Files
[Mobs](Mobs/VisibilityMob.yml) & [Skills](Skills/VisibilitySkills.yml)

### Usage
Once the files are installed in your mythicmob directories create a scoreboard value in game named **'Visibility'** of type dummy, then reload MythicMobs and summon the VisibilityMob. Here you can see me toggle my scoreboard value of **'Visibility'** from NULL to 1 to 0 to test the different boolean states that you can see the mob in.
